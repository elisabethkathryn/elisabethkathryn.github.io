  This project is inspired by Emerson College, Los Angeles by Morphosis Architect. As can be seen in this project, flat metal sheets can be attractively designed and arranged to form a very dynamic facade. Fabrication feasibility and efficiency become important considerations in the entire design process.</p>

<p>  Panel variations are rationalized into limited number of unit types. In addition to the panel folds, the L shape adds more directionality which make more variation to the overall look. The cutting shape is also optimized to minimize metal sheet waste. Laser cut and press brake machines, relatively common fabrication methods in metal industry, are used in this project.</p>
