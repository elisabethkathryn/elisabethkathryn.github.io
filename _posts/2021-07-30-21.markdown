&emsp;&emsp;The geometry is defined using ZHCODE’s 3D Graphic Statics tool which generates compression only funicular structures. Static equilibrium of the structures is described using two reciprocal force and form diagrams. Further exploration of timber materiality, joinery details, and robotic digital fabrication was also conducted as one integrative process in this workshop.
